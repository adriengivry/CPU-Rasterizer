# Rasterizer

Here is our student software rasterizer project. The project is divided into 7 main features :
- Z-Buffer
- Phong (Per-Vertex)
- Blinn-Phong (Per-Pixel)
- Wireframe with Backface Culling
- Bilinear filtering
- Alpha-Blending
- Anti-aliasing

Our rasterizer exploit the CPU.

## Project infos

The project was made in 6 weeks in a group of 2. It is runnable in x86 and x64 on Windows OS. You should use Visual Studio (We used 2017 version) to build our project because everything is already setup. Libraries are included to the project, you don't need to add anything, just press play ! We used SDL2 to draw pixels on screen, SDL2_ttf to draw UI, SDL2_Image to import PNG files, IrrKlang for audio (Yes, somewhere in the project there are some musics !)
There is an hidden "konami code" in the documentation which start a cool animation !
