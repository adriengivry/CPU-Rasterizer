# Rasterizer

Here is our student rasterizer project. The project is divided into 7 main features :
- Z-Buffer
- Phong (Per-Vertex)
- Blinn-Phong (Per-Pixel)
- Wireframe with Backface Culling
- Bilinear filtering
- Alpha-Blending
- Anti-aliasing

Our rasterizer exploit the CPU.

## Project infos

The project was made in 6 weeks in a group of 2. It is runnable in x86 and x64 on Windows OS.
There is an hidden "konami code" in the documentation which start a cool animation.
